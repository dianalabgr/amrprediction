## Machine Learning Predicts Antimicrobial Resistance from Genomic Data across ESKAPEE Pathogens

### ðŸ“– Description of the Study

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a mounting global crisis, fueled by the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Among the most concerning culprits are the ESKAPEE bacteria â€” *Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.*, and *Escherichia coli* â€” which are leading causes of hospital-acquired infections worldwide.

In this study, we developed and validated machine learning models for predicting antimicrobial resistance phenotypes directly from genomic data. We assembled a robust dataset of **18,916 ESKAPEE genome assemblies**, each paired with its corresponding antibiogram, covering susceptibility results for **40 different antibiotics**.

Using this data, we trained **Random Forest** and **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** models for each antibiotic separately, consistently achieving over **90% recall and F1 score** for most pathogenâ€“antibiotic combinations.

To maximize utility and accessibility:
- We developed an **interactive web platform**:  
  ðŸ‘‰ https://dianalab.e-ce.uth.gr/amrpredictor/  
  allowing users to explore predictions and SHAP-derived feature importance.

- We validated our pipeline on **36 blood culture-positive ESKAPEE samples**, showing strong concordance with conventional phenotypic testing.

- We provide all data and models in Zenodo:

Our work underscores the transformative potential of integrating genomics and machine learning to deliver accurate, interpretable, and clinically actionable predictions against AMR.
